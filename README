INTRO
This repository contains two separate Python programs written to achieve the exact same result: 
produce/export data that can be used to do a number of statistical analyses on Magic: The Gathering products. 
Intended as a portfolio project, the reason for writing two separate Python programs is to practice my skills in the Pandas library, as well as SQL and sqlite. 

The question that guided this project from the beginning was, broadly speaking, "how has the complexity of the game design of Magic:The Gathering changed over time?"
I narrowed the question of complexity down to two variables: 
1) Words printed on indivudal cards
2) Rulings on individual cards 

The Python scripts were written with those questions in mind, and -more specifically- my analysis seeks to plot those variables over time, 
organized within each Magic:The Gathering set of cards. 

Future analysis will apply more sophisticated statistical techniques to the data, but for now some preliminary charts can be viewed here:

USAGE
This program is not intended to be used interactively, but is mainly here for feedback and to showcase my current progress in learning Python, SQL, and Data Science.

DATA / REQUIREMENTS
SQLite 3 is needed to run the mtganalysis_sql.py file, as written. 
Both programs require the user to download bulk data files from the Scryfall API site. They are set to default to files included in this repository, however a user 
can download, rename, and enter their own files if desired.  The bulk data files provided by Scryfall are updated every 24 hours. 
You can download the following two data files from https://scryfall.com/docs/api:

Default Cards:
https://data.scryfall.io/default-cards/default-cards-20230623090636.json

Rulings:
https://data.scryfall.io/rulings/rulings-20230623090029.json

Save them as whatever you want, the program will prompt you for those file names.
